A Thesaurus For Programming Languages Jargon
==

For now, this is list of synonyms for technical words that I want to stop
keeping in my head and allow people to publicly contribute to/comment on.
Maybe one day I'll turn it into structured data that a tool can consume.

There's also a wiki for discussion: https://github.com/wilbowma/pl-thesaurus/wiki

- dependent function type, pi type, dependent product type, universal quantifier
  - This can be particularly confusing since, in non-dependent settings, product type can mean pair.
- dependent pair type, sigma type, dependent sum type, existential quantifier
  - This can be particularly confusing since, in non-dependent settings, sum type can mean tagged union.
- pair (type), product (type), tuple (type)
- sum (type), disjoint union (type), tagged union (type), variant (type) 
- dependent types, type dependency
  - The latter form can be confusing because dependency has been used to refer to information flow, as in the Dependency Core Calculus.
- certifying compilation, translation validation
- Galois connection, adjunction,
- Monad, (Kleisli) triple, closure operator, Pfenning-Davies S4 possibility modality
- Comonad, interior operator, Pfenning-Davies S4 necessity modality
- Embedding-projection pair, Galois Insertion/Injection, Coreflection
- Galois Surjection, Reflection
- Concretization function, upper adjoint, right adjoint
- Abstraction function, lower adjoint, left adjoint
